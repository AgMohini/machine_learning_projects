**Machine Learning Projects**
Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection represents a journey through the core concepts and practical applications of machine learning that I have studied and implemented. Each project here is a hands-on demonstration of the knowledge I’ve gained, and collectively, they showcase my command of fundamental and advanced machine learning techniques.

**About This Repository**
As part of my continuous learning in the field of data science and machine learning, I developed these projects to deepen my understanding of:

Supervised and unsupervised learning

Time series forecasting

Natural language processing

Anomaly detection

Model evaluation and governance

The notebooks in this repository reflect my growing proficiency in designing, developing, and validating ML solutions for real-world problems.
